## Architecture

The system is built on a modern, decoupled architecture:

- **Frontend**: A React-based landing page built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. Designed for deployment on Vercel.
- **Backend**: A Flask API that handles webhooks (Stripe, PayPal), fulfillment logic, and lead management. Designed for deployment as a Docker container.
- **Database**: A PostgreSQL database managed with Prisma. The schema is designed for Supabase but is compatible with any PostgreSQL provider.
- **Automations**: Python scripts for recurring tasks like the daily briefing generation, which can be run as cron jobs or triggered by services like Zapier.
- **Testing**: End-to-end tests using Playwright and error monitoring with Sentry.

## Database Setup

1.  **Get your PostgreSQL connection string** from your provider (e.g., Supabase).

2.  **Set the `DATABASE_URL`** in your `.env` file. This URL must include the password for your database user.

3.  **Apply the initial schema:**

    You can either run the `001_initial_schema.sql` file directly against your database or use Prisma to migrate the schema.

    **Using Prisma:**

    ```bash
    # Generate the Prisma client
    prisma generate

    # Push the schema to the database
    prisma db push
    ```

    This will create all the tables, enums, and relationships defined in `database/schema.prisma`.

---

## API Setup

The Flask API is the core of the system, handling webhooks and fulfillment.

1.  **Ensure all dependencies are installed:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r api/requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    python api/app.py
    ```

    The API will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

3.  **For production, use a WSGI server like Gunicorn:**

    ```bash
    gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 api.app:app
    ```

---

## Frontend Setup

The React landing page is built with Vite.

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd web/copykit-landing
    ```

2.  **Ensure dependencies are installed:**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

---

## Automation Setup

The automation scripts are designed to be run on a schedule.

### Daily Briefing (`A3-briefing-daily`)

This script fetches market data, scrapes news, generates content with an LLM, and creates audio/video assets.

-   **To run manually:**

    ```bash
    python automations/daily_briefing.py
    ```

-   **To schedule with cron:**

    Add the following line to your crontab to run the script daily at 7 AM BST:

    ```cron
    0 7 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/omni-revenue-agent/automations/daily_briefing.py
    ```

### Lead Intake (`A1-lead-intake`)

This script is designed to be triggered by a webhook from a form service (like Typeform or Jotform) via Zapier.

1.  Set up a webhook in your form provider.
2.  Configure the webhook to send a `POST` request to your API endpoint (e.g., `https://your-api-domain.com/api/leads`).
3.  The `lead_intake.py` script contains the logic that will be executed by the API when a new lead is received.

---

## Testing

The project includes an E2E test suite using Playwright.

1.  **Ensure testing dependencies are installed:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
    playwright install
    ```

2.  **Make sure both the frontend and backend development servers are running.**

3.  **Run the test suite:**

    ```bash
    pytest tests/e2e_tests.py
    ```

---

## Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel)

The frontend is optimized for deployment on Vercel.

1.  **Create a new project on Vercel** and connect it to your Git repository.
2.  **Configure the project settings:**
    -   **Framework Preset**: `Vite`
    -   **Build Command**: `pnpm run build`
    -   **Output Directory**: `web/copykit-landing/dist`
    -   **Install Command**: `cd web/copykit-landing && pnpm install`
3.  **Add your environment variables** to the Vercel project settings.
4.  **Deploy!** Vercel will automatically build and deploy your site.

The `vercel.json` file is included to ensure correct routing and configuration.

### Backend (Docker)

The Flask API is designed to be deployed as a Docker container.

1.  **Build the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t omni-revenue-agent-api -f Dockerfile .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker container:**

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env omni-revenue-agent-api
    ```

    This will start the API container and expose it on port 5000. You can deploy this container to any service that supports Docker, such as AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, or DigitalOcean App Platform.
